# Contributing to GitHub Productivity Analytics

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gh-productivity.git
   cd gh-productivity
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Using conda
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate gh-productivity
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up configuration**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.py config.py
   # Edit config.py with your test organization settings
   ```

4. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   python extract.py  # Test data extraction
   python web_dashboard.py  # Test dashboard generation
   ```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example Function Documentation

```python
def analyze_commit_quality(commit_message: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate quality score for a commit message.
    
    Args:
        commit_message: The commit message text to analyze
        
    Returns:
        Quality score between 0.0 and 10.0
        
    Examples:
        >>> analyze_commit_quality("fix: resolve login bug #123")
        8.5
    """
```

## Testing

When adding new features:

1. Test with different GitHub organizations (if possible)
2. Test with both public and private repositories
3. Verify dashboard generation works correctly
4. Test edge cases (empty repos, large repos, etc.)

## Feature Ideas

We're always looking for new ways to improve developer productivity insights:

### Data Analysis Enhancements
- **Code review metrics**: Time to review, review participation
- **Issue tracking**: Link commits to issue resolution time
- **Release analysis**: Commit patterns around releases
- **Team collaboration**: Cross-team contribution analysis

### Visualization Improvements
- **Real-time dashboards**: Live updating metrics
- **Comparative analysis**: Team vs. industry benchmarks
- **Drill-down capabilities**: Click to explore detailed data
- **Mobile-friendly dashboards**: Responsive design

### Integration Features
- **Slack/Teams integration**: Automated reports
- **CI/CD metrics**: Build success rates, deployment frequency
- **JIRA/Linear integration**: Project management correlation
- **Multiple organizations**: Compare across different orgs

### Performance & Scalability
- **Caching system**: Store API responses to reduce calls
- **Incremental updates**: Only fetch new data since last run
- **Large organization support**: Handle 100+ repositories efficiently
- **API rate limiting**: Smart throttling and retries

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Bug Report Template

```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set config with '...'
2. Run command '...'
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
What you expected to happen.

**Screenshots/Output**
If applicable, add screenshots or console output.

**Environment:**
- OS: [e.g. macOS, Ubuntu 20.04]
- Python version: [e.g. 3.11]
- GitHub organization type: [public/private/mixed]

**Additional context**
Any other context about the problem.

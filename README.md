## Configuration

### Quick Setup

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This will create `config.py` from the example and guide you through the setup.

2. **Edit `config.py` with your settings:**
   ```python
   # GitHub API Configuration
   GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_github_token_here"
   ORG_NAME = "your_organization_name"
   
   # LLM Analysis Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key_here"  # Get from Google AI Studio
   ENABLE_LLM_ANALYSIS = True  # Enable AI-powered insights
   
   # Core Team Members (customize for your team)
   CORE_TEAM = [
       "developer1",
       "developer2", 
       "developer3"
   ]
   
   # Add author mappings if team members use different names/emails
   AUTHOR_MAPPING = {
       "dev1@company.com": "developer1",
       "Developer One": "developer1",
   }
   ```

3. **Test your setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_setup.py
   ```
   This will verify that everything is configured correctly.

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Copy the example configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```

2. **Generate API Keys:**
   
   **GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
   - Generate a token with these scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`
   - For private repositories, ensure your token has appropriate access
   
   **Gemini API Key (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key for Gemini Pro
   - This enables AI-powered commit analysis and developer insights

## Usage

### Step 1: Extract Data

```bash
python extract.py
```

This will:

- Analyze commit history and messages
- Generate `commit_analysis.csv` and `developer_productivity.csv`

### Step 2A: Generate Traditional Dashboard

```bash
python web_dashboard.py
```

Creates `productivity_dashboard.html` with time-series analysis, filtering, and traditional metrics.

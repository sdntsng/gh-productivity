## üõ† Installation

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd gh-productivity

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gh-productivity
```

### Option 2: Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd gh-productivity

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Quick Setup

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This will create `config.py` from the example and guide you through the setup.

2. **Edit `config.py` with your settings:**
   ```python
   # GitHub API Configuration
   GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_github_token_here"
   ORG_NAME = "your_organization_name"
   
   # Core Team Members (customize for your team)
   CORE_TEAM = [
       "developer1",
       "developer2", 
       "developer3"
   ]
   
   # Add author mappings if team members use different names/emails
   AUTHOR_MAPPING = {
       "dev1@company.com": "developer1",
       "Developer One": "developer1",
   }
   ```

3. **Test your setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_setup.py
   ```
   This will verify that everything is configured correctly.

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Copy the example configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```

2. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Generate a token with these scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`
   - For private repositories, ensure your token has appropriate access

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Initial setup:**
   ```bash
   python setup.py      # Set up configuration
   python test_setup.py # Verify everything works
   ```

2. **Run analysis:**
   ```bash
   python extract.py    # Extract data from GitHub
   python web_dashboard.py  # Generate dashboard
   ```

3. **View results:**
   Open `productivity_dashboard.html` in your browser for interactive insights!

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: Extract Data

```bash
python extract.py
```

This will:
- Fetch all repositories from your organization
- Analyze commit history and messages
- Generate `commit_analysis.csv` and `developer_productivity.csv`

### Step 2: Generate Dashboard

```bash
python web_dashboard.py
```

This creates `productivity_dashboard.html` - an interactive web dashboard you can open in your browser.

### Optional: Static Charts

```bash
python dashboard.py
```

Generates `productivity_dashboard.png` with static matplotlib charts.

## üìà What You Get

### CSV Outputs
- **`commit_analysis.csv`**: Detailed commit-level data with quality scores
- **`developer_productivity.csv`**: Aggregated developer statistics and rankings

### Interactive Dashboard
- Weekly activity trends for each developer
- Commit quality progression over time
- Lines of code statistics (additions, deletions, net changes)
- Repository activity heatmaps
- Working hours pattern analysis
- Performance comparison charts

## üîß Advanced Configuration

The `config.py` file offers extensive customization options:

### Quality Scoring
Customize how commit quality is calculated:
```python
QUALITY_WEIGHTS = {
    'has_issue_ref': 2.0,        # References issue/ticket
    'follows_convention': 1.5,    # Follows conventional commit format
    'good_length': 1.0,          # Appropriate message length
    'has_body': 0.5,             # Has commit body/description
    'not_merge': 0.5,            # Not a merge commit
    'not_hotfix': -0.5           # Penalty for hotfix commits
}
```

### Data Collection
Control what data is collected:
```python
INCLUDE_PRIVATE = True      # Include private repositories
EXCLUDE_ARCHIVED = True     # Exclude archived repositories  
INCLUDE_STATS = True        # Include detailed line count statistics
```

### Team Management
Filter and organize your team data:
```python
CORE_TEAM = ["dev1", "dev2", "dev3"]  # Your core team members

EXTERNAL_CONTRIBUTORS = {              # Contributors to exclude
    "dependabot[bot]",
    "github-actions[bot]",
    "external-contractor"
}
```

## üîê Private Repository Access

For organizations with private repositories:

1. **Install GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install gh
   
   # Other platforms: https://cli.github.com/
   ```

2. **Authenticate with GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

The tool will automatically use GitHub CLI for private repository access when needed.
